"""Let me begin my essay by saying that summer holidays is an excellent way to relax and take some time for yourself. It’s no secret that summer is the favorite time of the year for all schoolchildren, because in summer there is the longest vacation. My summer was full of exciting moments and I would like to present you with two of them.
Firstly, I was fortunate enough to visit one of the most wonderful cities in the world, London. There I was with my friends during the tennis competition. In between trainings and tournaments, we were allowed to walk around the city, thus we visited many historical sites such as the National Gallery and Trafalgar Square. In addition, there were many more memorable moments, but what I remember best is when we decided to stay up all night to watch the dawn because I really enjoyed the aesthetics of the city at night.
Secondly, I had a wonderful time in the village with my grandmother. Every morning I had to get up early and help my grandmother around the house and in the yard, therefore, by the evening I was always tired. However, this did not prevent me from having fun with my childhood friends, and we often went to the river or to the forest at night and watched the stars. What I liked the most was that on one of the clear nights, we saw a star rain that was both exciting and frightening at the same time, but still beautiful.
Taking everything into consideration, I can definitely say that this summer was unforgettable for me thanks to those wonderful moments that happened to me. I am sure that everyone should feel the same as me during their vacation, because this is just a wonderful state."""
